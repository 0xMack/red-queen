# frontend

Nuxt 4 app visualizing `apis/backend`'s runs/metrics/games. See
[../../docs/design/0005-frontend-and-api-contracts.md](../../docs/design/0005-frontend-and-api-contracts.md)
for the full contract and incremental plan this implements (steps 3-4).

## Contents

- `app/pages/index.vue` — run list (`GET /runs`), links to each run's detail page.
- `app/pages/runs/[id].vue` — one run's live metrics: backfills history
  (`GET /runs/{id}/metrics/history`), then opens an `EventSource` against
  `GET /runs/{id}/metrics/stream` for live updates, tearing the connection down on unmount.
- `app/stores/runs.ts`, `app/stores/metricsStream.ts` — Pinia stores (auto-imported by
  `@pinia/nuxt` from `app/stores/`) holding the run list and the live-metrics subscription,
  respectively.
- `app/components/FitnessChart.vue` — a hand-rolled SVG polyline chart (best/mean fitness vs.
  generation). No charting library dependency for this skeleton -- doc 0005 named
  Nuxt/Vue/Pinia/Tailwind specifically; a charting library is a separate decision to make later if
  the hand-rolled version stops being enough.
- `app/pages/play/[game].vue` — play a game (`/play/snake` today) server-side: creates a session
  (`POST /games/{game}/sessions`), then a `setInterval` tick posts the current pending action
  (`POST /games/{game}/sessions/{id}/actions`) and re-renders. Controls are Snake's native relative
  action space directly (&larr;/&rarr; = turn, otherwise straight) -- doc 0005's worked example of
  absolute-direction controls with client-tracked heading is specifically for the Pyodide version
  (step 5), where the simulation moves client-side and this per-tick round trip goes away.
- `app/components/GridBoard.vue` — renders a `RenderState` (`{width, height, cells, score, alive}`)
  as an SVG grid. Generic over any grid game's cell labels, not Snake-specific.
- `app/stores/runs.ts`, `app/stores/metricsStream.ts` — Pinia stores (auto-imported by
  `@pinia/nuxt` from `app/stores/`) holding the run list and the live-metrics subscription,
  respectively.
- `app/components/FitnessChart.vue` — a hand-rolled SVG polyline chart (best/mean fitness vs.
  generation). No charting library dependency for this skeleton -- doc 0005 named
  Nuxt/Vue/Pinia/Tailwind specifically; a charting library is a separate decision to make later if
  the hand-rolled version stops being enough.
- `app/types/telemetry.ts`, `app/types/games.ts` — TypeScript interfaces mirroring
  `apis/backend`'s response models (`telemetry.RunInfo`/`GenerationStats` reused directly;
  `backend.schemas.GameSessionState` et al.) — keep in sync by hand if those change.
- `nuxt.config.ts` — `runtimeConfig.public.apiBase` (default `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, override via
  `NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` -- copy `.env.example` to `.env`), Tailwind CSS 4 wired in via
  `@tailwindcss/vite` (not the `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss` module), Pinia via `@pinia/nuxt`.

## Running it

Needs `apis/backend` running first (see `apis/backend/README.md`) and at least one recorded run
(`uv run python jobs/baseline_gp_run.py` from the repo root writes to `jobs/run-data`, which is
`apis/backend`'s default data source).

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Notes

- Package manager is `pnpm` (this app's own `node_modules`/lockfile -- separate from the repo's
  Python `uv` workspace, no JS workspace at the repo root yet since there's only one JS package).
- Verified with a live backend + a headless-browser check (Playwright, run ad hoc, not checked in
  as a test yet): the run list renders real data via SSR, navigating to a run detail page opens a
  real SSE connection (`connected` flips to `live`), backfills existing generations, and renders
  the chart with zero console errors. `/play/snake` was verified the same way, including real
  keyboard input actually changing the snake's path and a died/restart round trip. No automated
  frontend test suite yet -- that's a gap to close before this grows much further, not a decision
  to leave open indefinitely.
